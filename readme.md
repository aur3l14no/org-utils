## A Collection of org-related Utilities

This project is also to learn OCaml programming.

### Roadmap & Features

Since I'm still learning OCaml and severely lack experience, the project is going to be highly pragmatic and ad-hoc, satisfying only my own needs.

The capability of generalization is not considered!

1. (Coarsely Done) Migration from org-journal daily to vanilla year-month-day journal (parser combinators, ...)
2. (TODO) Provide stats for my org files
